# prescribr
The prescribr package uses several publicly available (at least for now) data sources from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services to study the relationship between pharmaceutical industry payments to physicians and their prescribing behavior. This package is the continuation of work that originally published in *[Jama Internal Medicine](http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2528290)* in June 2016. Since then,  2014 Medicare Part D prescribing data and 2015 Open Payments data has been made publicly available.
